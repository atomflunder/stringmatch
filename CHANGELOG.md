## v0.14.2 - 2023-06-06

## v0.14.0 - 2022-07-29

-   Added support for Python 3.8
    -   Support for 3.7 and below is unlikely since we make some use of the walrus operator
    -   3.6 and below are EoL anyways and 3.7 is due to follow in 2023

## v0.13.0 - 2022-07-25

-   Removed Levenshtein as a dependency and replaced it with RapidFuzz
    -   Under the hood Levenshtein was basically only calling RapidFuzz functions anyways, so we save ourselves the overhead
    -   As a result stringmatch is now a tiny bit faster
-   Custom Scorers now need to return a float between 0 and 100, instead of 0 and 1

## v0.12.5 - 2022-07-09

-   Removed Ratio Keyword Arguments Class
    -   Constructing the Ratio Class just manually now
    -   This should be a tiny bit faster, but not noticeable by any means
-   Adding docs
-   Added examples in docstrings

## v0.12.4 - 2022-07-06

-   Removed the specific rapidfuzz version from the list of installed packages
    -   The error encountered earlier seemed to have gone away

## v0.12.3 - 2022-07-05

-   Added mypy to the required packages, fixed installation

## v0.12.2 - 2022-07-05

-   Bumped Version to make installation process easier

## v0.12.1 - 2022-07-05

-   Fixed Custom Scorers being broken accidentally

## v0.12.0 - 2022-07-04

-   Using mypyc to compile (again)
    -   Various smaller changes to accomodate mypyc
    -   Roughly doubles speed of library
-   Holding rapidfuzz to 2.0.15 for now, 2.1.0 and above will break the library.
    -   This is because editops are not implemented (yet), hopefully this will change soon.

## v0.9.0 - 2022-05-01
